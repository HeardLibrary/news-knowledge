<b>News Knowledge</b> is a podcast focusing on insights regarding televised news media.

In this podcast we explore the many ways that the Vanderbilt Television News Archive's collection of national news broadcasts can be utilized to understand the complex nature of televised news. Through interviews with educators, researchers, technologists, documentarians, and others, we hope to amplify the ideas and voices which shape our understanding of the current events that we witness as citizens through our nation's televised media outlets.

In short, we want to join in the ongoing conversations that focus on improving news literacy for all of us in the 21st century.
