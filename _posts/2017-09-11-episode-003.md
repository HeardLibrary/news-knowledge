Don Sheldon was among the early aviation pioneers who developed the piloting skills necessary to land and take off from glaciers in Alaska, and was the focus of a 1974 CBS Evening News story by reporter Charles Kuralt. This episode of News Knowledge features excerpts of our interview with Shelton's son Robert and grandson Ryan, interspersed with excerpts of news reports about their famous ancestor, as well as the behind-the-scenes details of their family's contribution to the official renaming of Mt. McKinley to Denali in 2015.
