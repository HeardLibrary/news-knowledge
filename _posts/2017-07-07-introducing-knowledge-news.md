We're very happy to announce the launch of News Knowledge, a podcast focusing on insights related to televised news media, produced here at Vanderbilt University. The Television News Archive at the Vanderbilt University Library maintains the nation's most extensive archive of broadcast news recordings in the United States. The TV News Archive began recording in August 1968 and will reach its fiftieth year anniversary next summer. How may library projects can claim such a legacy of achievement for the social good?

In this podcast, two staff members of the Television News Archive, Russ Mason and Skip Pfeiffer, interview archivists, researchers, and social activists who depend on access to this fair, impartial, and objective record of broadcast television news. We hope that you, our listeners, enjoy the window that this podcast opens on how major events in our nation's recent history have been shared and disemminated. 

We also invite your to take advantage of your [statuory right](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108) to [explore and loan news segements](https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/requests) from our archive. Of course, you are also always welcome to visit us in Nashville! 

Thanks for listening! And please let us know what you think.
